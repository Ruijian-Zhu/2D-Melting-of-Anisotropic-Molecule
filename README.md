# 2D-Melting-of-Anisotropic-Molecule

These Cpp programs can be used for analyzing the two-dimensional phase transition of general systems. There are basically four physical quantities are evaluated: translational correlation function, bond-orientational correlation function, body-orientational order parameter (also the distribution of monomer body orientation), and the Voronoi analysis of topological defects. For the first two quantities, we provide two different programs for each, one is for rectangular box while the other is for triclinic box. All the input data should be created from LAMMPS. Below we will describe each program in more detail
